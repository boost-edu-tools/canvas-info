"""Command to create a students info file from a Canvas assignment.

The create_students_info_file is a function to create a students info excel file
for a Canvas assignment: All students assigned to this assignment are
listed and written to the students file. If the assignment is a group
assignment, the student groups are written instead.

Because the login ids of students can be different in Canvas and git, a
mapping needs to be made via a database containing both login ids for each
student. This database should be a csv file and have a canvas_id and git_id
column.


Usage:

```
repobee -p canvas canvas create-students-yaml-file \
        --canvas-assignment-id 23 \
        --canvas-git-map student_data.csv
```

will create file `students.yaml` with all Git account names of the
students involved in assignment with ID=23.

If you want to use a different output filename, set the filename in the GUI.
